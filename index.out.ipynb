    "Psychometrics in general have long relied on rule-of-thumb cutoff values for various goodness of fit metrics. With more powerful personal computers it is both feasible and desirable to use simulation/bootstrap methods to determine appropriate cutoff values. This paper illustrates and evaluates the use of an R package for Rasch psychometrics that has implemented functions to simplify the process of identifying misfitting items using simulation based cutoff values. Through a series of simulation studies a comparison is made between information weighted conditional item fit and item-restscore using Goodman and Kruskal’s gamma.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper presents a series of simulations conducted to evaluate methods to detect of item misfit in Rasch models. First, conditional item infit and outfit will be under scrutiny. Second, item infit will be compared to item-restscore ([Kreiner 2011](#ref-kreiner_note_2011); [Mueller and Santiago 2022](#ref-mueller_iarm_2022)). Third, a bootstrap method for item-restscore will be presented and tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Müller ([2020](#ref-muller_item_2020)) showed how the range of conditional item infit varies with sample size and the expected average item infit range is fairly well captured by Smith’s rule-of-thumb formula (1±2/√n). However, the average range does not apply for all items, since item location also affects model expected item fit which means some items may have plausible item fit values outside Smith’s average value range.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is proposed that by using parametric bootstrapping one can establish item fit cutoff values that are sample and item specific. The R package `easyRasch` ([Johansson 2024](#ref-easyrasch)) includes a function to determine item infit and outfit cutoff values, which will be tested in the simulations in this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the conditional item fit described by Müller ([2020](#ref-muller_item_2020)) and implemented in the `iarm` R package ([Mueller and Santiago 2022](#ref-mueller_iarm_2022)) is different from the unconditional item fit implemented in software such as Winsteps and RUMM2030, as well as all R packages except `iarm`. Unconditional item fit can result in unreliable item fit in sample sizes as small as 250 with increasing likelihood of problems as sample size increases. Readers are strongly recommended to read Müller’s paper to fully understand the problems with unconditional item fit.\n",

    "1.  How does the number of iterations used in RIgetfit() impact the indicated cutoff values?\n",

    "3.  Müller ([2020](#ref-muller_item_2020)) hints at outfit being less useful than infit. We will investigate this by comparing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "20 dichotomous items are used, with one item misfitting. Item locations are the same throughout. The location of the misfitting item relative the to the sample theta mean was selected to be approximately 0, -1, and -2 logits. Three separate datasets were generated with these variations, each with 10 000 simulated respondents. One dataset with all three misfitting items was also generated, using the same sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `RIgetfit()` from the `easyRasch` R package is tested here. It’s source code can be accessed on GitHub. The function offers the user a choice of the number of bootstrap iterations to use to calculate the cutoff values for infit and outfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the `RIitemfit()` function is used to summarize the bootstrap results and also calculates the infit and outfit for each item in the observed data and highlights items with infit/outfit values outside of the cutoff values. `RIitemfit()` has a default setting to slightly truncate the distribution of values using `stats::quantile()` at 0.001 and 0.999 to reduce extreme values. An example is demonstrated in <a href=\"#tbl-itemfit1\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 1</a>, using a subset of the items used in the simulations. <a href=\"#fig-itemfit1\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 1</a> provides a visualization of the distribution of bootstrapped infit and outfit values, together with the infit/outfit values from the observed data illustrated using an orange diamond shape. Note the variation between items in plausible values of infit and outfit based on the bootstrap, and that Smith’s rule-of-thumb regarding infit (1±2/√n) would be 0.9-1.1 for a sample size of 400.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study was rather computationally demanding since each simulation run entailed 100-400 underlying simulations. The sample sizes used were 150, 250, 500, and 1000. The number of iterations to determine cutoff values were 100, 200, and 400. Sample size and iteration conditions were fully crossed with each other and the three different targeting variations of the one misfitting item, resulting in 4*3*3 = 36 conditions. Each combination used 200 simulation runs. The simulations took about 12 hours to run on a Macbook Pro Max M1 using 9 CPU cores."

    "\n",
    "Based on these simulation, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of infit in determining item fit over outfit. The performance of outfit calls to question whether it is useful at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding infit, it looks like 100 iterations are to recommend to determine cutoff values when the sample size is 250 or lower, while 200 or 400 iterations reduce the risk for false positives at sample sizes of 500 or larger. False positives are found at sample sizes 500 and 1000 only. The risk for false positives is notably higher when the misfitting item is located at the sample mean compared to when the misfitting item is off-target by -1 logits or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings make a good argument for removing one item at a time when the analysis indicates misfit, starting with the most misfitting item. This is especially relevant for sample sizes at 500 or above and when misfitting items are located close to the sample mean.\n",
