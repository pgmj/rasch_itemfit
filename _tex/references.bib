	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{smith_using_1998,
	title = {Using item mean squares to evaluate fit to the {Rasch} model},
	volume = {2},
	issn = {1090-655X},
	abstract = {Throughout the mid to late 1970's considerable research was conducted on the properties of Rasch fit mean squares. This work culminated in a variety of transformations to convert the mean squares into approximate t-statistics. This work was primarily motivated by the influence sample size has on the magnitude of the mean squares and the desire to have a single critical value that can generally be applied to most cases. In the late 1980's and the early 1990's the trend seems to have reversed, with numerous researchers using the untransformed fit mean squares as a means of testing fit to the Rasch measurement models. The principal motivation is cited as the influence sample size has on the sensitivity of the t-converted mean squares. The purpose of this paper is to present the historical development of these fit indices and the various transformations and to examine the impact of sample size on both the fit mean squares and the t-transformations of those mean squares. Because the sample size problem has little influence on the person mean square problem, due to the relatively short length (100 items or less), this paper focuses on the item fit mean squares, where it is common to find the statistics used with sample sizes ranging from 30 to 10,000.},

A new method, weighted likelihood estimation (WLE), is derived, and proved to be less biased than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with the same asymptotic variance and normal distribution. WLE removes the first order bias term from MLE. Two Monte Carlo studies compare WLE with MLE and Bayesian modal estimation (BME) of ability in conventional tests and tailored tests, assuming the item parameters are known constants. The Monte Carlo studies favor WLE over MLE and BME on several criteria over a wide range of the ability scale.},
